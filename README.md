# Code Challenge: Machine Translation Microservice

This repository consists on a proposed solution to a technical challenge raised during the selection process for a Senior Backend Developer position.

---

## Content

This is a **Symfony** project for a **REST API** application, with a development environment configured in **Docker**.

## Installation

- Clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:jgarciatorralba/translator-microservice-challenge.git`
- Navigate to the `/.docker` folder, then run `docker-compose up -d` to download images and set up containers.
  - **Important**: the configuration is prepared to expose the server container's port on host's port 8000, the database container's port on host's 6432, and the message broker container's port on hosts' 5672 and 15672, so make sure they are available before running the above command.
- Once completed, open with VisualStudio and in the command palette (*View > Command Palette*) select the option *"Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"*.
- Inside the development container, install packages with `composer install`.
- Even though an empty database named **app_db** should have been created with the installation, you can still run `sf doctrine:database:create` for good measure.
- With the database created and the connection to the application successfully established, execute the existing migrations in folder `/etc/migrations` using the command `sf doctrine:migrations:migrate`.

---

## Tests

- Run the complete test suite by executing the command: `php ./vendor/bin/phpunit`
  - **Important**: make sure to clear Symfony's testing cache by running `sf cache:clear --env=test` before executing the tests.

---

## Scripts

- Run _PHPUnit_ tests: `php ./vendor/bin/phpunit`
- Run _CodeSniffer_ analysis: `php ./vendor/bin/phpcs <filename|foldername>`
  - Correct detected coding standard violations: `php ./vendor/bin/phpcbf <filename|foldername>`
- Run _PHPStan_ analysis: `php ./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse <foldernames>`
- Delete existing database: `sf doctrine:database:drop --force`
- Run worker to consume messages queued in the message broker: `sf messenger:consume async -vv`
